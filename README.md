# PokemonAndroidVersion
Hello, my name is Gabriel Bouhnik.
I have developed a Pokemon mobile game in Kotlin on Android Studio. 
You can download my project and install it on your phone or an android emulator with Android Studio or Intellij
and inform me of the bugs you encounter in the game.
An Internet connection is required to display the Pokemon sprites.
